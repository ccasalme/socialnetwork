## **Installation**  
To run this API locally, you must have **Node.js** and **MongoDB** installed on your machine.  

### **Steps to Install:**  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/social-network-api.git
   cd social-network-api
   ```  
2. **Install Dependencies**  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```  
3. **Setup Your Environment Variables**  
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.  
   - Add the following line and replace `<your_database_uri>` with your actual MongoDB connection string:  
     ```env
     MONGODB_URI=<your_database_uri>
     ```  
   - Ensure `.env` is **added to your `.gitignore` file** to prevent accidental exposure.  

4. **Start the Server**  
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## **Usage**  
1. Start the API server using:  
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```  
2. Use **Postman** or **Insomnia** to test API endpoints.  
3. Use the following **CRUD API endpoints** to interact with the database.
